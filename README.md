# MusicFileRenamer

# Program to rename all music files to the way i like it, with the track number - song title
# Padded with an extra zero for tracks under 10
# To be called from the directory that is the root of all the music, D:\Music for me, but cant be called from any directory.


# Used to clean up track numbers and print them the way that I like
# For example 02 - Start Me Up.mp3
